The error message you received indicates that the file 'IMG_20210917_214858.jpg' within the ZIP file is corrupted and cannot be opened. As a result, the entire ZIP file cannot be extracted.
There are a few possible reasons why the file may be corrupted, such as an incomplete download or a problem with the original file. You could try re-downloading the ZIP file again to see if that resolves the issue.
Alternatively, you could try using a ZIP repair tool to fix the corrupted file within the ZIP file. One such tool is called "Zip Repair Pro". You can download and install this tool on your system, and then use it to repair the corrupted file within the ZIP file.
If neither of these options work, you may need to contact the owner of the ZIP file to obtain a new, uncorrupted version of the file.
