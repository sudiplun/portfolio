## Install command line tool pdftoppm

To use the `pdftoppm` command-line tool, you need to first install `pdftoppm` which is a part of the poppler / poppler-utils / poppler-tools package. Install this package as follows depending on your Linux distribution

 ``sudo apt install poppler-utils``     [On Debian/Ubuntu & Mint]
 ``sudo dnf install poppler-utils ``    [On RHEL/CentOS & Fedora]
``sudo zypper install poppler-tools `` [On OpenSUSE]
``sudo pacman -S poppler  ``           [On Arch Linux]

### Convert PDF Document to Image

 ``pdftoppm -<image_format> <pdf_filename> <image_name>``

### Imagemagick for image to pdf

 ``sudo apt install imagemagick`` [On Debian] 

``sudo dnf install imagemagick`` [On RHEL/CentOS & Fedora]

In that case, all you need is to edit the **policy.xml** file using an editor like vim.
 ``sudo vim /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml``

 Look for the line in the following example:
 <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" />
 To fix the error, replace the rights from “none” to “read|write”

### To jpg to pdf

``convert *.jpg all.pdf``
